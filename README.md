# C++ Conditional Statements

This repository contains examples and explanations of conditional statements in C++. Conditional statements are used to control the flow of a program based on certain conditions. This README provides an overview of commonly used conditional statements in C++ and how to use them.

## Conditional Statements

### if Statement

The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true. If the condition is false, the code block is skipped.

```cpp
if (condition) {
    // Code to execute if the condition is true
}
```

### if-else Statement

The `if-else` statement is used to execute one block of code if a condition is true and another block of code if the condition is false.

```cpp
if (condition) {
    // Code to execute if the condition is true
} else {
    // Code to execute if the condition is false
}
```

### if-else-if-else Statement

The `if-else-if-else` statement is used to test multiple conditions. It allows you to execute different blocks of code based on the first condition that evaluates to true.

```cpp
if (condition1) {
    // Code to execute if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    // Code to execute if condition2 is true
} else {
    // Code to execute if none of the conditions are true
}
```


## **ALGORITHM**

- **Check Even or Odd Algorithm using If-Else**:

1.Start

2.Declare an integer variable (e.g., num) to store the number to be checked.

3.Prompt the user to enter the number and store it in the num variable.

4.Use an if-else statement to check whether the number is even or odd:

5.Check if num % 2 == 0 (i.e., if the remainder when dividing num by 2 is equal to 0).

5.If the condition is true, then the number is even.

6.If the condition is false, then the number is odd.

7.Display the result to the user.

8.End

- **Camparison between 3 numbers and print largest numbers using if else**

*Compare and Print Largest Number Algorithm using If-Else*:

1.Start

2.Declare three integer variables (e.g., num1, num2, and num3) to store the three numbers.

3.Prompt the user to enter the three numbers and store them in the respective variables (num1, num2, and num3).

4.Use a series of if-else statements to compare the three numbers and determine the largest number:

5.Check if num1 is greater than num2 and num3.

- If true, num1 is the largest number.
- If not, check if num2 is greater than num1 and num3.
- If true, num2 is the largest number.
- If neither of the above conditions is true, num3 is the largest number.

6.Display the largest number to the user.

7..End
